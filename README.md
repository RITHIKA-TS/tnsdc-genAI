#chatbot using Keras:
##Overview:
This project implements a chatbot using Keras, a high-level neural networks API running on top of TensorFlow. The chatbot is designed to engage in conversation with users, responding to their queries and providing relevant information.

##Features:
Natural language processing (NLP) for understanding user input.
Intent recognition to determine the user's purpose or query.
Response generation based on learned patterns and data.
##Requirements:
Python 3.x
Coloroma
TensorFlow
Scikit learn
##Data:
The chatbot model is trained on a dataset containing pairs of user queries and corresponding responses.
##Training:
The training process involves preprocessing the data, building and training the neural network model using Keras.
