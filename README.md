# Chatbot using Keras:

## Overview:
This project implements a chatbot using Keras, a high-level neural networks API running on top of TensorFlow. The chatbot is designed to engage in conversation with users, responding to their queries and providing relevant information.

## Features:
Natural language processing (NLP) for understanding user input.
Intent recognition to determine the user's purpose or query.
Response generation based on learned patterns and data.

## Key Features:
### Natural Language Understanding: 
The chatbot employs natural language processing techniques to understand user input and generate appropriate responses.
### Deep Learning with Keras: 
Keras is used to build and train deep learning models for conversation generation, allowing the chatbot to learn from and adapt to user interactions over time.
### Scalable and Modular Design: 
The project is structured in a modular and scalable manner, allowing for easy integration of additional features and expansion of conversational capabilities.
### Pre-processing and Tokenization: 
Text pre-processing techniques such as tokenization and normalization are applied to raw input data to facilitate effective training and inference.
### Response Generation:
Responses are generated by the chatbot using a combination of rule-based approaches and sequence-to-sequence models, providing varied and contextually relevant interactions.
### Training and Evaluation: 
The chatbot model is trained on a dataset of conversational transcripts, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as perplexity, accuracy, and user satisfaction.

## Requirements:
Python 3.x
Coloroma
TensorFlow
Scikit learn

## Data:
The chatbot model is trained on a dataset containing pairs of user queries and corresponding responses.
## Training:
The training process involves preprocessing the data, building and training the neural network model using Keras.
